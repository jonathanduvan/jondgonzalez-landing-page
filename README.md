  Welcome to my landing page!
  
  The structure for the page was made entirely using CSS and HTML, along with only flexboxes. 
  
  I was able to add a background, google font, gradient, icons, and styling for the input text and button.
  However, the design for making it more mobile friendly was unsuccessful, specifically the layout for the link heading sections for smaller screens.
  
  I would like to point out the overall design of the landing page, with the use of colors and design to give off this minimalist vibe, along
  with a gentle gradient that fades into the same purple used in the top section of the background.

The screen caps for assignment are in this repo.
